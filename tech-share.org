* Introduction - Who is this guy?
 - Chris Johnson Bidler
 - Joined SPS Commerce in June of 2014, on Document Engine team
 - Lives in South Bend, IN but ironically doesn't follow college football
 - Software developer since 1998, *mostly* Java, some C/C++, some Perl
 - Long tenure in healthcare IT, moved to retail SaaS in 2011
 - Interested in big data, web-scale + real-time
 - Also interested in UI concerns, mitigating perceptual bias
 - I have an app on the iOS App Store
* Clojure - Elevator summary
 - Clojure is a dialect of LISP that compiles to Java bytecode and runs in the JVM
 - (many) advantages of LISP
   - First-class functions and macros provide expressive power Java lacks
   - Pure functions encourage de-complecting "state management" and "business logic"
   - REPL allows for very fast development cycles
 - (many) advantages of the Java ecosystem
   - Interop with Java code is dead easy
   - Decades of performance work on the JVM benefits Clojure directly
   - Can use web-scale and cloud solutions for the JVM
* What does Clojure ask you to do?
  - Be willing to learn new things
    - LISP syntax is not harder than Java/Python, but is different
    - Thinking about problems as composed functions instead of collaborating objects
    - Build tools are strictly better than Maven, but still have a (gentle) learning curve
  - Think carefully about your code
    - Functional approach turns the object-oriented world a bit on its head
    - Keeping state of data and transforms on data separate can take getting used to
* What does Clojure offer you in return?
  - Excellent concurrency support at the language level
  - Very rapid prototyping and development
  - Virtually no "boilerplate" code to accomplish tasks
    - Smaller functions that can be composed
    - Easier to understand a system quicky when it fits on a screen
  - Solving problems becomes about solving the problems
* When might you want to consider Clojure
  - You are starting a new project
    - Getting polyglot *IDE-level projects* to build and run can be a challenge
    - Polyglot projects that federate smaller services are much easier
  - Interop needs are amenable
    - Java
    - REST APIs
    - Queue endpoints (JMS, SQS, etc.)
  - Team is on board and has some cycles to learn new things
* When might you *not* want to consider Clojure
  - Working with a large legacy codebase
    - Dropping new .clj into a Java project can be a headache
  - Hard interop requirements with native non-Java
    - Python libraries with no Java equivalent
    - Proprietary data formats (do we have these?)
  - Building a thick-client GUI application
  - Performance needs not met by modern JVMs
    - If you're writing in C to get closer to the metal, Clojure can't help you
* Live coding example: FizzBuzz
* Questions?
* Resources
* Thanks for listening!
